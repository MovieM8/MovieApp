# Movie Web Application

## Project Overview
This project is a web application designed for movie enthusiasts. The application provides an interactive platform where users can search for movies, browse cinema showtimes, create groups, and share movie reviews and favorite lists. The application leverages open data sources to provide real-time information about movies and theater schedules.  

The frontend is built using **React**, the backend uses **Node.js**, and **PostgreSQL** serves as the database.

---

## Open Data APIs

The application integrates the following open data sources:

1. **The Movie Database (TMDb)**  
   - Provides a large collection of movie-related data.  
   - Requires registration to obtain an API key/token.

2. **Finnkino API**  
   - Offers open access to theater schedules in XML format.  
   - No registration required.

## Installation & Setup

1. Clone the repository:  
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>


2. Navigate to the project folder and install dependencies for frontend and backend:
    ```bash
    cd frontend && npm install
    cd ../backend && npm install

3. Set up PostgreSQL database and configure environment variables for API keys and database connection.

4. Run the application:
    ```bash
    npm start

## Usage

- Ensure API keys for TMDb are valid and set in the environment variables
- The Finnkino API returns data in XML format; the application parses this data for display
- All group-related content is private to members unless explicitly shared
